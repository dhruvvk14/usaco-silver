//lets sort them, because why not?
//Observation 1: for any interval to fit between k, their start value â‰¤ k (as their start value can't be larger than k itself, as values can't be negative)
//this means that when this happens, we can automatically end our process
//Observation 2: for TC 3-5, we must pre process our information. We can find the upper and lower value of K which works for each pairing. 
//This still isn't enough, we must know more than the lower and upper bounds. We can use inverse prefix sums to find out the actual value...
//Observation 3: when K = 0, a part of K = 1's answer will use K = 0's answer. Specifically, it is when K = 0 is the upperbound...
//In mathematical terms: ans(k + 1) = ans(k) - ans(when k is upper bound) + ans(when k + 1 is upper bound)
//This is a recursive formula, which requries a base case, when K = 0...
